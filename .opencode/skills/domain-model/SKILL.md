description: Canonical domain model and its derivation chain on the machinery design substrate. Use when the project's design.machinery setting applies (auto detects a machinery-managed repo), when the legacy dnf.domain_model setting is enabled, or when the user asks about the domain model, entities, invariants, ubiquitous language, state machines, oracles, stable ids, the relational layers (policy, integrity, isolation), rebuild or hybrid migration, the surface ledger, or how stories derive from the design.
version: 2.1.0

# Domain model in D&F (machinery Phases 1 and 3)

The model is `design/domain.modelith.yaml`, authored with modelith and linted by
`modelith lint`: the single canonical source of the product's entities, relationships,
and invariants. The three D&F documents reference it; they never redefine vocabulary.
On the machinery substrate it starts a derivation chain: lifecycle enums become state
machines (Phase 3), machines generate transition oracles, static relational invariants
compile into Alloy models with their own decision-table oracles (Phase 1.5), and every
oracle row carries a content-derived STABLE ID (tokens like `DEAL-eb0c40`) that stories
and tests key on.

## When this applies

`pvg settings design.machinery` resolves it (auto | on | off), same as the c4 skill.
Legacy `dnf.domain_model=true` keeps the v1 flow until the model moves under `design/`.
Both `modelith` and `machinery` converge via `pvg update`.

## Role map

| Role | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| BA / Designer | Feed the interrogation, sweeping the five EARS behavior categories by name (ubiquitous, event-driven, state-driven, optional, unwanted); unwanted and state-driven are the chronically under-specified two, and they become negative invariants now and lifecycle states and guards in Phase 3. Brownfield: for every tangle, ask "this looks messy because <specific observation>; what is your desired end state?" The code says what IS; only the user can say what SHOULD BE. |
| Architect | Owns the model (gate: `modelith lint` clean; every lifecycle entity has a status enum; every invariant an owner). When the model carries static relational invariants, also owns the opt-in Phase 1.5 annotations, `design/formal/{policy,integrity,isolation}.relational.yaml`: `machinery alloy design/` compiles each present layer, `machinery verify-formal` solver-checks them, and gates gp/gi/gn hold binding, coverage, and freshness deterministically. Owns Phase 3 too: one machine per stateful component, then `machinery oracle design/machines`. An annotation or machine edit and its regenerated artifacts land in the SAME change; staleness is DRIFT and blocks. |
| Architect (rebuild/hybrid) | Owns BOTH domain truths: `design/legacy/domain.modelith.yaml` (the system as it is) and `design/domain.modelith.yaml` (the normative target), never merged into one compromise model. Owns the strict transition contract `design/migration.yaml` (gate Gm-transition: every legacy entity disposed, every enum value covered, ordered phases with entry/exit, rollback, and cutover criteria) and the surface ledger `design/legacy/surface.yaml` (gate Gs-surface), authored by the opening sweep and settled by the closing sweep after Gate 4. |
| Sr PM | Dereferences the design into stories: invariants become ACs; for machine-covered slices the ORACLE ROWS are the test spec and ACs cite stable ids verbatim (whole tokens). `pvg rtm` fails when any oracle id has no covering story; run it before Anchor submission. Backlog derivation starts from BUILD.md's Build plan section, whose shape Gb-plan holds deterministically (milestones with `DoD:` lines; the walking-skeleton milestone's DoD cites a committed oracle id). On rebuild/hybrid, also derives migration-step stories from `migration.yaml`'s ordered phases (entry/exit criteria and rollback become ACs) and surface-parity stories from ledger rows. Model the stateful core only. |
| Anchor | `pvg rtm` in the deterministic pre-pass ([ORACLE] rows use exact token matching). On rebuild/hybrid, also verifies backlog coverage of the transition: every migration phase and replace-mapping has a story, and every surface ledger row is story-covered or carries a deliberate dropped/deferred rationale (no opening placeholders at handoff; the Gs `checked:` line prints the disposition counts). Attests what the tools cannot: whether the invariants are the RIGHT ones (a shallow model gates clean), and the judgment half of the relational layers: gp/gi/gn prove binding, coverage, and freshness, not that an annotation captures the real policy or that its declared residuals are genuine. |
| Developer | Derives hard-TDD RED tests from the cited oracle rows, keyed on stable ids. Gt-tests is the RED-exit check made deterministic: with `impl` configured, every committed oracle stable id (machine, policy, isolation) must appear whole-token in the suite, or a test file must earn the strict conformance-parse citation. `pvg story approve-red` verifies this before the suite locks. |
| PM | On design revisions, `pvg story sync-oracle --base <ref>` maps the stable-id diff onto affected stories: added or modified ids need tests re-derived, removed ids mark tests to retire. |

## Machinery implies hard-TDD

On a machinery-managed repo, hard-tdd stops being an opt-in nicety: the design ships a
test oracle and Gt-tests holds the implementation to it. The Paivot rule: any story
whose ACs cite oracle stable ids MUST carry the `hard-tdd` label; `pvg lint --backlog`
enforces this deterministically as the `hard-tdd-oracle` check. Hard-tdd is the Sr PM
DEFAULT for machine-covered slices; the label is omitted only for stories that touch no
oracle (CRUD screens, pure transforms).

## Codebase archaeology (brownfield)

Excavate the model from code, schema, and production data AS IT IS; record incoherence
as open questions. When a codebase-graph MCP is available (codebase-memory-mcp or
equivalent), index the repository first and drive the excavation through its tools
instead of grep. Start this dialog on day one, in parallel with the boundary baseline.
When the system has role- or ownership-based access control, author the policy
annotation as the code BEHAVES today and let the meta-checks and the generated authz
oracle arbitrate; a failing row is a discovered incoherence, adjudicated like any other
archaeology finding.

## Format and deep dives

`modelith schema` for the YAML format. The four-phase pipeline, machine annotations,
oracle contract, relational layers, rebuild/hybrid mode, the surface ledger, and
revision mode: the machinery skill (`machinery install --home ~/.agents`) and its
references (`rebuild-guide.md`, `surface-ledger.md`, `xstate-format.md`,
`c4-standalone.md`). Reference formats, never restate them.
